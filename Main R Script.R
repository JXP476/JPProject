# Initial quality control & data preparation:
# ** 1st= Filtering out lowly expressed genes **
# (In test = TREATED VS UNTREATED. In mine = 1. TUMOUR VS NORMAL 2. T VS N in EACH PATIENT
# 1st interest is testing TUMOUR VS NORMAL groups
# To check how many samples we have each group= use the table command
counts <- geneExpressionCPM
targets <- patientData
# I think the above assignment step is irrelevant but have left in for now^
table(patientData$Tissue)
# ^ Normal-7, Tumour-20
# So the minimum sample size is 7
# Check the relationship between CPM and counts to see what CPM threshold we should be imposing
# Users should filter with CPMs rather than filtering on the counts directly
# latter does not account for differences in library sizes between samples
# Need to READ combine-australia general tutorial for info on how CPM filtering works
# Recall weâ€™re looking for a CPM that corresponds to a count of roughly 10-15.
